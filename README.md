# `hardware.inc`
### Gameboy Hardware definitions
`hardware.inc` has been the standard include file containing Game Boy hardware definitions for use in [rgbds](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds) projects for over 20 years.

The file was originally created by Jeff Frohwein in 1997, who still hosts [his latest version (2.3)](http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/hardware.zip) on his great [Dev'rs](http://devrs.com) website.

Although Jeff tried to version control the file with a rudimentary change log at the top of the file, people have added small changes throughout the years, often without bumping the version number.

This repo is an attempt at version control, using [@AntonioND](http://github.com/AntonioND) fork as baseline.
